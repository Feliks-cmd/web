		<h1>Hacking: Firewalls and Proxy servers</h1>

		<p>
			A <em><strong>firewall</strong></em> can be either software or hardware. It sits between the user's computer and an external network <span class="auto-style1"> (e.g. the internet) and filters information in and out of the computer.</span>
		</p>

		<h2>A firewall performs two major roles:</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Provides defense against external threats by refusing unauthorized 
			connections to the router from potential attackers such as hackers.
			<br />
			</li>

			<li>It also protects the network infrastructure from within. In other words, 
			it blocks outgoing connections from the router. It mitigates the spread of 
			viruses, keyloggers, or malware that have sneaked past the router and on the 
			network. Such malicious software might transmit confidential data back to 
			the hacker such as passwords. Only a firewall is able to prevent them from 
			doing so by inhibiting their connection.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Therefore, it is important that a firewall is installed and managed by a professional system administrator to provide the maximum amount of protection to your company’s network infrastructure. When done correctly, the advantages of using firewalls cannot be ignored. Their main benefits are:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Policing</em></strong>: A firewall acts as a security guard that monitors or polices 
				the outgoing and incoming traffic from/to your network. It analyzes the information being sent or received and either allows it or blocks it, depending upon the rules established within the firewall.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong><em>Blocks Malicious Programs</em></strong>: Firewalls have the ability to block potential 
				malware, viruses, and Trojan horses from infecting your network system. 
				Trojan horses are the most dangerous because they attach themselves to files 
				and when you transmit these files, they do further damage to other computer 
				systems. Plus, they reveal your confidential information to web 	servers 
				being hosted by potential hackers.
				<br /><br />
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong><em>No More Hackers</em></strong>:A firewall can stop a hacker dead in their tracks. 
				Hackers can cause loss of data and damage to an organization’s computer 
				systems, while they might even use these systems to carry out illegal 
				activities.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>However, there are certain circumstances where the firewall can't Prevent potential harmful 'traffic':
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				It cannot prevent indivisuals on internal networks, using their own 
				<strong>modems</strong>(a device that converts signals produced by one type of device (such as a computer) to a form compatible with another (such as a telephone)) to bypass the firewall.
			</li>

			<li>
				Employee misconduct or carelessness cannnot be controlled by the 
				firewalls (for example: control of passwords or use of accounts)
			</li>

			<li>Users on standalone computers can choose to disable the firewall , 
				leaving their computer open to harmful 'traffic' from the internet.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Proxy servers</h2>

		<p>A proxy server acts as a gateway/intermediary between the user and the web server.
		</p>

		<p>
		<img alt="Proxy Servers - Computer Science GCSE GURU" src="Proxy-Server.png" /></p>
		<p>Functions of a proxy server:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allowing the internet' traffic' to be filtered; they can block access to 
			a website if necessary (similar type of reaction as a firewall)</li>
			
			<li>Using a feature knwown as <strong><em>catche, </em></strong>they can 
			speed up access to information from a website </li>
			
			<li>Keeping the user's IP address a secret- this clearly improves security </li>

			<li>Acting as a firewall</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			A firewall and a proxy server are both components of network security; 
			firewalls block programs and ports that try and gain access unauthorized access to you computer, while proxy servers hide your internal network from the 
			internet.
