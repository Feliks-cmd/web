        <h1><a id="spyware">SPYWARE</a></h1>

        <p>
        	According to the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, spyware is any ‘software that enables somebody to obtainsecret information about somebody else and their computer activities without their knowledge or permission’
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	Essentially spyware allows someone to spy on someone else’s computer, and steal data from them.
        </p>


        
         

        <div style="margin-right: 2%;">

          <h3><a id="hijack">BROWSER HIJACK</a></h3>
          
          <img alt="spyware img" src="pictures/spywaresquare.png" style="display: block; padding:0% 5% 0% 0%; height: 90%; margin-right: 10%;">
          
        
          <p>A browser hijacker is a form of unauthorized software that changes the 
        settings of a web browser without the user's permission. As a result, 
        unnecessary advertisement may be shown in the browser, and an existing home page 
        or search page may be replaced with the hijacker page. A browser hijacker, also 
        known as a browser redirect virus because it redirects the browser to other, 
        usually malicious, websites, enables browser hijacking.</p>
        
          
        
	        <h2><a id="ADWARE">ADWARE</a></h2>
	          
	       

	          <p>According to the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary Adware is: <br> “a type of software that displays or downloads advertisements that are not asked for on a computer screen, smartphone, etc. when a user is online”</p>
	        
	      

	          <p>Adware is usually bundled into online downloads for applications or files. it is commonly a form of Pay per download, or PPD, or the programs are owned by the creator of the download and so the are paid for every ad that gets shown</p>

	        
	          

			
			<h2><a id="LOGGERS">KEYBOARD LOGGERS</a></h2>
	        
	          <p style="margin: 2%>Keyboard loggers or keyloggers are a software that records all of your key strokes and where they were inputted into, this would allow people to track all the information you input into your computer including sensitive information like passwords or credit card information. Much like adware they are commonly placed into online downloads for applications or files. </p>
	        
	          <br>

	          <p style="margin: 2%">All these forms of spyware are either a PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) or PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program). They are 
	        usually automatically identified by and blocked or deleted by most antiviruses</p>
	   
	     </div>

        <h1><a id="DDOS">DDOS</h1>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <img alt="DDOS BANNER" src="pictures/ddos_banner.png" style="   display: block;
          margin-left: auto;

          width: 99%;"/>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>DDOS stands for distributed denial of service.<br>
        DDoS attacks occur when servers and networks are sent with a large amount of traffic. The goal is to overwhelm the website or server with so many requests that the system becomes inoperable and cannot function.
        <br>This can be done using many different tools such as :
        </p>



        <li>Tor's Hammer</li>
        <li>Slowloris</li>
        <li>LOIC</li>
        <li>XOIC</li>

        <br>

        <p>DDOS attacks are illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. A DDOS Attacking a network without permission can result in a ten-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine.</p>

        <h1><a id="zero">Zero day attacks</h1>
        <p>This is the malicious exploitation of known vulnerability in a system,in order to gain access to it.<br>
        They can be protected from using zero day protection.<br>
        Zero day attacks can come in the form of zero day viruses too, where viruses are used to infect networks with malware
        </p>
