		<h1>Hacking: Keeping data safe with passwords(Including 
		Biometrics) and Symmetric encryption </h1>

		<h2>Hackers</h2>
		<p>
			A Person who uses computers to gain access to unathorized 
			data which is the information stored in devices.Hackers usually get the data 
			from people devices or private companies which is a huge risk, hackers are 
			usually people who have technical skills. They usually get access to your 
			information using your own password.</p>
		
		<h2>Passwords</h2>
		<p>
			What is a password? well a <strong>Password </strong>is a string of characters used to verify the identity of a user. They are designed to be known only to the user and allow that user to gain access to a device, 
			application or website, passwords can vary in length and can contain letters, 
			numbers and symblos (<strong>IT IS ADVICED THAT YOU USE A LONG AND RANDOM 
			PASSWORD THAT IS EASY TO REMEMBER SO THERE IS LESS OF A CHANCE OF GETTING 
			HACKED)</strong></p>
		<p class="auto-style5">Some Methods to ensure that your password is safe is 
		using:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style5"><em><strong>Biometrics</strong></em>- Statistical 
			analysis of people's unique physical features and is used to identify and 
			access control or for identifying individuals who are under survaillance.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>2 or 3 Factor Authentication</strong> 
				This is a security process that increases the likelihood that a person is 
				who they say they are. The process requests users to provide two or three 
				diffrent authentication factors before they are able to access an 
				application or system rather than simply their username or password.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Encryption</h2>
		<p class="auto-style5">There are two main types of encryption:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Symmetric encryption
			</li>

			<li>
			Asymmetric encryption
			</li>

	
		<h3>Symmetric encryption</h3>
		<p>
			Symmetric Encryption is a secret key which can be a 
			combination of characters. If this key is applied to a message, its content is 
			changed which makes it unreadable unless the recipient also has the decryption 
			key. One key is needed to encrypt a message and another key is needed to decrypt 
			a message. It is obvioulsy important that the sender and receiver have the same 
			encryption and decryption key. There is clearly a security risk here, since the 
			sender has to supply the key to the recipient. This key could be intercepted by, 
			for example, a hacker which puts the security of the encrypted message at risk. 
			This situation is referred to as the Key Distribution Problem.
		</p>


		<h3>Asymmetric Encryption</h3>
		<p>
			A more secure method is to use Asymmetric or public key 
			encryption. A private key and public key are both needed:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				A public key is made available to everyone
			</li>

			<li>
				A private key is only known by the computer user
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			types of keys are needed to encrypt and decrypt 
			messages.
		</p>

			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How to avoid beign hacked</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style5">Do not click any random links that you were sent </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style5">Do not give anyone your email or passwords </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style5">use a vpn to be anonymous on the web</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style5">use the cloud backup</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style5">Make sure that website is secured </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style5">use 2 factor authentication </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style7">I got most of my information from:</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style7">searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/password</p>
