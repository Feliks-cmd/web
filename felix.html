		<h1>Ransomware</h1>
		<div>
		<p>
			A <b>Ransomware</b> is a type of malware that threatens to publish a victims data or 
			block access to their data unless a ransom is paid, in the form of 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">bitcoin</a>, witch makes the transaction 
			untracable and the attacker remains anonymous. Some well known types of Ransomware were

		<h2>How to protect yourself from ransomware</h2> <!--backups-->
		<p>
		Having a <b>backup</b> is a good way to protect your data. If an attacker threatens you to 
		pay a ransom to receive your data access, all you have to do is restore your data from the backup.
		If in a case where your data is physically destroyed, your backup 
		data will come in handy to restore your data. However attackers are aware that most organisations  
		take the precation to backup their data and that even a successfull attack would fail their 
		expectations. So they tend to attack the backup files first then attack the system.<br><br>
		Additionally installing an antivirus to protect from ransomware is essential. Training security 
		teams, whitelisting computer applications and developing disaster plans can help in protecting 
		aganist data breaches.  

		</p>

		<h2>What to do to prevent a ransomware attack</h2> <!--firewalls-->
		<p>
		Avoid clicking links sent to you via email and esapecially spam emails as they could be linking to 
		a malware download on your system. Avoid downloading files from websites that your organisation 
		prevents you from visiting and any other untrusted websites. Keep your personal data to yourself 
		and report scammers who tend to ask personal information. Keep your systems up to date with the 
		latest software. Lastly, it's not advisable to negotiate with criminals into paying the ransom. You cannot
		ensure that the attacker woun't hang on to your data or leak it after the ransom is payed. This will heavily depend on the value of data.   

		</p>

		<h2>Are you a target for ransomware?</h2>
		<p>
			An attacker will often target large organisations depending on different factors.
			For instance an attacker will look at how important or sencitive the data is which
			may determine wheather the victim will pay the ransom or not. Other factors include
			<a href="https://www.packetlabs.net/unpatched-vulnerabilities/">unpatched vulnerabilities</a> 
			in the system's organisation which makes it ideal for an attcker to target.

		<h1>Trojan horses</h1>
		<div>
		<p>
			A <b>Trojan horse</b> or <b>Trojan</b> is a type of malware that is desguised as a legitimate 
			software. the victim is tricked into installing the malware by some form of 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)">Social engineering</a>.
			The term is derived from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Horse">Ancient Greek</a> story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy. 
		</p>


		<h2>Previous trojan horse attacks</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Worm">Storm Worm</a> was a particularly vicious malware that made the rounds in 2006, with a malicious email with the subject line: <b>‘230 dead as storm batters Europe’</b>. Intrigued, people would open the email and <b>click on a link</b> to the news story and that’s when the problems started. Storm Worm was a Trojan horse that infected computers, sometimes turning them into <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/zombie-computer-zombie-bot#:~:text=A%20zombie%20(also%20known%20as,either%20financial%20gain%20or%20malice.">zombies or bots</a> to continue the spread of the virus and to send a huge amount  malicious spam mail.

		<h1>Worms</h1>
		<div>
		<p>
			A computer <b>worm</b> is a standalone malware program that produces clones itself to later spread to other computer systems. It will often spread itself in a computer network, relying on security failures on the target machine as a host to scan and find other computers to infect.
		</p>

		<h2>Previous worm attacks</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mydoom">MyDoom</a> was considered to be the most damaging virus ever released that spread through emails. <b>Mydoom</b> also took the next step in controlling many of the computers to execute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Distributed Denial of service</a> attacks on large companies like Google, SCO and Microsoft.
