			A <b>Ransomware</b> is a type of malware that threatens to publish a victims data or 
			block access to their data unless a ransom is paid, in the form of 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">bitcoin</a>, witch makes the transaction 
			untracable and the attacker remains anonymous. Some well known types of Ransomware were

		<h2>How to protect yourself from ransomware</h2> <!--backups-->
		<p>
		Having a <b>backup</b> is a good way to protect your data. If an attacker threatens you to 
		pay a ransom to receive your data access, all you have to do is restore your data from the backup.
		Additionally, in the case where your data is physically destroyed, let's say by a fire your backup 
		data will come in handy to restore your data. However attackers are aware that most organisations  
		take the precation to backup their data and that even a successfull attack would fail their 
		expectations
		and so they tend to attack the backup files first then attack the system.<br><br>
		Additionally installing an antivirus to protect from ransomware is essential. Training security 
		teams, whitelisting computer applications and developing disaster plans can help in protecting 
		aganist data breaches.  

		</p>

		<h2>What to do to prevent a ransomware attack</h2> <!--firewalls-->
		<p>
		Avoid clicking links sent to you via email and esapecially spam emails as they could be linking to 
		a malware download on your system. Avoid downloading files from websites that your organisation 
		prevents you from visiting and any other untrusted websites. Keep your personal data to yourself 
		and report scammers who tend to ask personal information. Keep your systems up to date with the 
		latest software. Lastly, it's not advisable to negotiate with criminals into paying the ransom. You cannot
		ensure that the attacker woun't hang on to your data or leak it after the ransom is payed. This will heavily depend on the value of data.   

		</p>

		<h2>Are you a target for ransomware?</h2>
		<p>
			An attacker will often target large organisations depending on different factors.
			For instance an attacker will look at how important or sencitive the data is which
			may determine wheather the victim will pay the ransom or not. Other factors include
			<a href="https://www.packetlabs.net/unpatched-vulnerabilities/">unpatched vulnerabilities</a> 
			in the system's organisation which makes it ideal for an attcker to target.
